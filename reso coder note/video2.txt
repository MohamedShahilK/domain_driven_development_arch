=> We will take this principle and take it to a whole another level. You see, 
  not all validation is equal. We're about "to perform the safest validation" of them all - 
  we're going to "make illegal states unrepresentable". In other words, we will make it 
  impossible for a class like "EmailAddress" to "hold an invalid value" "not just while it's in the 
  TextFormField" but "throughout its whole lifespan."
